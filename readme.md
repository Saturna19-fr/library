## Purpose
**PyLS** is an indexing library designed to organize and manage books using their ISBN numbers. The project aims to simplify the process of cataloging books by utilizing barcodes that correspond to ISBNs.

## How It Works
- Users can scan barcodes using their phone or camera.
- The barcode scanned corresponds to the ISBN of the book.
- If a valid entry is found, the book is added to the database automatically.
